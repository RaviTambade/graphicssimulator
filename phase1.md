### **Phase 1: Planning and Requirements Gathering (2-3 weeks)**

Phase 1 is crucial for setting the foundation of the project. It ensures that everyone involved has a clear understanding of the project goals, scope, and requirements. A comprehensive planning and requirements gathering phase helps mitigate the risk of misaligned expectations, delays, or scope creep later in the project. Here's a detailed breakdown of what this phase involves:

---

### **1. Define Project Objectives**
The first step in this phase is to clarify the **main goals** of the software, the problem it is intended to solve, and the desired outcomes.

#### **Objective Questions to Answer**:
- **Why are we building this software?**  
  (For example: To provide engineers and designers with a tool to create and visualize engineering drawings and simulations.)
  
- **Who is the target audience?**  
  (For example: Engineers, architects, designers, students, etc.)
  
- **What value will the software provide to the users?**  
  (For example: Speeding up the design process, improving accuracy, allowing real-time collaboration, etc.)

#### **Deliverables**:
- Project mission statement.
- High-level vision and goals.

### **2. Identify Stakeholders and Team**
The next step is to identify all the **key stakeholders** and form a **project team**.

#### **Stakeholder Identification**:
- **Internal stakeholders**: These could include product owners, project managers, development team members, UX/UI designers, and QA testers.
- **External stakeholders**: End-users, business managers, clients, investors, and potential partners (if applicable).

#### **Team Formation**:
- **Project Manager**: To oversee timelines, resources, and overall project management.
- **Product Owner**: To define the scope, features, and prioritize tasks.
- **Development Team**: To work on coding, implementation, and technical development.
- **UX/UI Designer**: To create wireframes, mockups, and ensure the design is user-friendly.
- **QA/Testers**: To ensure that features work as expected and the application is reliable.
- **DevOps/Cloud Engineers** (if cloud-based): To plan for deployment, storage, and scaling.

#### **Deliverables**:
- List of stakeholders.
- Formation of the development team.
- Defined roles and responsibilities.

### **3. Requirement Gathering**
Gathering **functional** and **non-functional requirements** is critical for guiding the entire project. This step includes collecting input from all stakeholders (especially end-users) to understand their needs and expectations.

#### **Functional Requirements**:
These are the core features and functionalities the application must support. For this project, they might include:

- **Core Drawing Features**: Line, circle, and rectangle drawing tools, snapping to grid, and creating shapes.
- **Advanced Drawing Tools**: Object manipulation tools (resize, move, delete), layers, grouping of objects.
- **Annotations and Dimensioning**: Ability to add dimensions and labels.
- **File Import/Export**: Support for common file formats like DXF, SVG, etc.
- **Collaboration**: Real-time collaboration features.
- **Simulation**: Visualizing how components interact or fit together.
- **User Interface (UI)**: Clear, intuitive design with an easy-to-use toolbar and property editor.

#### **Non-Functional Requirements**:
These are the qualities and constraints of the system that are essential for its success. Some non-functional requirements could be:

- **Performance**: Fast rendering of complex drawings, minimal lag when zooming or manipulating objects.
- **Scalability**: The software should be able to handle large drawings with multiple layers or objects.
- **Usability**: The software should have an intuitive interface that both novice and advanced users can easily navigate.
- **Security**: If cloud-based, the system must be secure, with proper user authentication and data encryption.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: The software should be compatible with different operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux) or be web-based for broader accessibility.

#### **Activities for Gathering Requirements**:
- **Stakeholder Interviews**: Conduct interviews with potential users (engineers, architects, students) to understand their pain points and needs.
- **Surveys/Questionnaires**: Distribute questionnaires to gather feedback from a broader audience on required features.
- **Competitive Analysis**: Look at existing engineering drawing tools (like AutoCAD, SketchUp, etc.) to identify gaps in functionality or areas for improvement.
- **Workshops/Brainstorming Sessions**: Collaborate with the development team and stakeholders to refine the scope and features.

#### **Deliverables**:
- Functional requirements document.
- Non-functional requirements document.
- User stories for each feature (e.g., "As a user, I want to be able to draw a circle so that I can create basic shapes for my design.").

### **4. Define the Scope and Prioritize Features**
Once the requirements are gathered, the next step is to define the **project scope** and prioritize which features will be part of the initial release and which ones can be added later.

#### **Scope Definition**:
- **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**: What are the minimum features required for the first version of the software? This could include basic drawing tools, save/load functionality, and file import/export features.
- **Future Features**: Features that are not critical for the first release but will be added in later iterations (e.g., 3D visualization, simulation, cloud storage).

#### **Prioritization**:
Use a framework like **MoSCoW** (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) to prioritize the features:

- **Must Have**: Basic drawing tools, file saving/loading, and basic user interface.
- **Should Have**: Object manipulation, dimensions and annotations, basic object grouping.
- **Could Have**: Cloud storage, collaboration features, 3D visualization.
- **Won't Have**: Advanced simulation, AI-based drawing tools (for future releases).

#### **Deliverables**:
- Clear project scope.
- Feature prioritization (using MoSCoW or similar methods).
- MVP definition.

### **5. Risk Assessment and Mitigation**
Before starting the development, it's important to assess potential risks that could delay or derail the project. Some risks might include:

- **Technical Challenges**: Difficulty in implementing certain features, such as 3D visualization or real-time collaboration.
- **Integration Issues**: Problems when integrating with other tools or systems (e.g., file format compatibility).
- **Performance**: The software may not handle large, complex drawings efficiently.
- **Timeline Delays**: Misestimation of the time required to build certain features or resolve issues.
- **Changing Requirements**: The scope may expand as new requirements emerge.

#### **Risk Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Prototyping**: Create early prototypes of complex features to identify potential issues early.
- **Agile Methodology**: Work iteratively and adapt to changing requirements or unforeseen challenges.
- **Frequent Communication**: Regularly check in with stakeholders and adjust the scope or priorities as needed.

#### **Deliverables**:
- Risk register (identifying risks, impact, likelihood, and mitigation plans).

### **6. Define the Technology Stack and Tools**
Selecting the appropriate **technology stack** is essential for the project’s success. This includes selecting programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools.

#### **Technology Decisions**:
- **Frontend**: What frameworks or libraries will be used for building the user interface? (e.g., React.js, Vue.js, or a desktop framework like Electron or Qt for cross-platform support).
- **Backend**: If needed, what will handle data management, user authentication, and storage? (e.g., Node.js, Django, Flask, etc.).
- **Graphics Engine**: What library will be used for drawing and rendering? (e.g., OpenGL, WebGL, or Canvas for 2D rendering).
- **Cloud Storage**: If cloud features are required, which provider will be used? (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure).
- **Database**: What database system will be used (if needed)? (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Firebase).
  
#### **Deliverables**:
- Technology stack document.

---

### **7. Create Project Timeline and Milestones**
Define the project’s **timeline**, with specific milestones and deadlines for each phase and iteration. This should align with the **agile sprint cycle** and provide a clear roadmap.

#### **Milestone Examples**:
- Completion of MVP (end of Iteration 1).
- First complete feature set (end of Iteration 2).
- Final version release (end of project).

#### **Deliverables**:
- Detailed project schedule, broken down by sprints and milestones.
- Gantt Chart or Kanban board to track progress.

### **8. Document the Project Plan**
At the end of Phase 1, you'll have a **Project Plan Document** that outlines everything gathered and defined during this phase:

- **Project objectives**.
- **Detailed requirements** (functional, non-functional, and user stories).
- **Scope and features** (with prioritization).
- **Risk assessment and mitigation strategies**.
- **Technology stack**.
- **Project timeline and milestones**.
- **Stakeholder and team roles**.

This document will serve as the foundation for all future work and ensure that the project is aligned with the original goals.
