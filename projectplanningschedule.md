     - Implementing **collaborative drawing features** (real-time editing or drawing sharing).
     - Developing authentication and user management (if needed).
     - Enhancing version control for drawings (history, restore previous versions).
     - Testing collaborative features with a team of users for real-time synchronization.
     - UI/UX improvements based on user feedback.
     - Refining **security** and **data protection** features.

---

#### **Phase 8: Final Testing, Bug Fixing, and Optimization**  
   - **Duration**: 3-4 weeks  
   - **Activities**:
     - Comprehensive **system testing** for stability, performance, and security.
     - **Bug fixing** and resolving all known issues.
     - Performance optimization (e.g., handling large files, improving rendering speed).
     - Final user acceptance testing (UAT) with stakeholders and early adopters.
     - Documentation updates (final user guide, API documentation if needed).
     - Preparing deployment scripts for final release.
     - Deployment to production and cloud environments.

### **2. Project Scheduling Using Gantt Chart**
For scheduling purposes, a **Gantt Chart** is highly useful to visualize timelines for each phase and iteration. Here's how it would look:

| **Phase / Iteration**                             | **Start Date**  | **End Date**    | **Duration**  |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Phase 1: Planning and Requirements Gathering**  | Week 1          | Week 3          | 2-3 weeks     |
| **Phase 2: Architecture and Core Development**    | Week 3          | Week 6          | 3-4 weeks     |
