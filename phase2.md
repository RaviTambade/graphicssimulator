### **Phase 2: Architecture and Core Development (3-4 weeks)**

Phase 2 is crucial for laying the technical foundation of the Engineering Drawing Graphics Simulator. In this phase, the focus is on **system architecture design**, setting up the **development environment**, and beginning the **core software development**. It helps ensure that the project is technically feasible, scalable, and modular. A solid architectural base will make future enhancements easier and the system more maintainable.

### **1. Software Architecture Design**

The first task in this phase is to define the **software architecture**. The architecture is the blueprint for how the system is structured and how different components interact with each other. A well-thought-out architecture ensures that the system is scalable, modular, and easy to maintain.

#### **Key Components of the Architecture**:
- **Modular Structure**: Break down the application into distinct modules, such as the **drawing engine**, **user interface**, **file handling**, and **simulation engine**. This modularity helps in isolating different parts of the system for better development, testing, and maintenance.
  
- **Component Interactions**: Define how different modules will interact with each other. For example, how the user interface will communicate with the drawing engine or how simulation components will interact with the drawing objects.

- **Graphics Rendering Engine**: Decide on the engine or technology that will be used for rendering drawings (e.g., **Canvas API** in HTML5, **WebGL**, or a **C++** graphics library if building a desktop application). The rendering engine will be central to the application as it handles all the drawing operations.

- **User Interface (UI)**: Plan how the UI will be structured to allow users to interact with the drawing canvas, select tools, and modify the drawing elements. Choose between using a **web-based UI** (e.g., React.js, Angular) or a **native desktop UI** (e.g., Electron, Qt).

- **Data Management**: Define how drawings and data will be stored (locally or in the cloud). If working with files, you'll need to support different formats (e.g., **SVG**, **DXF**, or custom formats for the simulator).

- **Integration of Third-party Libraries/Frameworks**: Determine whether any external libraries will be integrated into the architecture (e.g., libraries for 3D visualization or object manipulation).

#### **Activities for Architecture Design**:
- Define the **modular structure** (drawing engine, file handling, UI, etc.).
- Choose the **graphic rendering technology** (WebGL, Canvas, OpenGL).
- Create architectural **diagrams** to represent how modules interact.
- Define **data flow** and object relationships.
- Decide on the **scalability requirements**, such as supporting large drawing files or future expansion to 3D modeling.

#### **Deliverables**:
- **Software Architecture Document** (including system diagrams, modular breakdown, and component interactions).
- **Prototype or mockups** of the UI and core design concepts.

### **2. Setting Up Development Environment**

Once the architecture is decided, you will set up the **development environment**. This involves creating a stable environment that supports the technology stack, ensuring that all developers and team members are working with the same tools, configurations, and processes.

#### **Key Steps in Setting Up the Development Environment**:
- **Version Control Setup**: Set up a **Git repository** (e.g., using **GitHub** or **GitLab**) for version control. Establish branching strategies (e.g., **Git Flow**) and commit conventions for team collaboration.
  
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement a **continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)** pipeline using tools like **Jenkins**, **GitHub Actions**, or **GitLab CI**. This ensures automated building, testing, and deployment throughout development.

- **Development Tools Setup**: Ensure all developers are equipped with the necessary development environments:
  - IDEs (e.g., **VS Code**, **IntelliJ IDEA**, or **PyCharm**).
  - Graphics libraries installed (e.g., **Three.js** for 3D rendering or **Fabric.js** for 2D).
  - Debugging tools.
  - Linting and code formatting tools to maintain code quality.

- **Database Setup**: If the application involves storing user data or drawing history, set up the necessary **database systems** (e.g., **PostgreSQL**, **MongoDB**, or **Firebase** for cloud storage).

- **Testing Framework Setup**: Install testing tools such as **Jest**, **Mocha**, or **Jasmine** for unit and integration tests, ensuring the software's correctness from day one.

#### **Deliverables**:
- **Development environment configuration** (repository, CI/CD pipeline, tools).
- **Documentation** on how to set up the development environment for new developers.

### **3. Initial Core Development**

With the architecture and development environment in place, the focus shifts to the initial **core development** tasks, such as implementing the fundamental features and core modules. At this stage, you'll implement the foundational components of the software that form the backbone of the entire system.

#### **Key Areas of Core Development**:

1. **Graphics Engine**:
   - Develop the basic **drawing engine** that allows rendering of simple shapes (lines, circles, rectangles).
   - Implement basic **canvas handling**, like zooming, panning, and grid display.
   - Implement **snapping** (snapping to the grid or to other objects) for precision in the drawing process.

2. **User Interface (UI)**:
   - Design and implement the **core user interface** to allow users to interact with the application.
   - Include basic **toolbars**, **tool selectors** (for line, circle, rectangle, etc.), and **canvas controls** (zoom, undo, redo).
   - The UI should be responsive and intuitive for the user, with clear indications of the current active tool.

3. **File Handling**:
   - Implement the ability to **save** and **load** drawings in a specific format (e.g., SVG, DXF, or a custom internal format).
   - Basic **file management** should include options to create, open, and save projects.
  
4. **Basic Object Manipulation**:
   - Implement the ability to select, move, and resize drawing objects.
   - Create a **bounding box** or drag handle to allow easy manipulation of shapes.

#### **Development Activities**:
- Implement core **drawing functionality** (canvas, drawing tools).
- Set up **event listeners** for user input (mouse, keyboard, or touch).
- Code basic **file saving and loading** features.
- Build the **basic UI** components (toolbar, buttons, etc.).
- Integrate basic **drawing object manipulation** (move, resize, delete).

#### **Deliverables**:
- **Working prototype** with core drawing tools implemented (basic lines, rectangles, circles).
- **Basic file handling** capabilities (save/load).
- **User interface** for tool selection and canvas interaction.

### **4. Early Integration and Testing**

Even though development is still in its early stages, it’s important to start integrating the different components of the application and performing basic testing.

#### **Integration Activities**:
- **Integrate core modules** like the graphics engine, user interface, and file handling.
- **Run basic unit tests** for individual components (drawing tools, UI functionality).
- **Perform integration testing** to ensure that modules interact correctly (e.g., clicking a drawing tool in the UI correctly triggers the drawing engine).

#### **Testing Activities**:
- **Unit testing** for individual functions (e.g., drawing lines, saving/loading).
- **Integration testing** for system components (e.g., UI triggering the drawing engine, loading saved drawings).
- **Usability testing** with a small group of users to get feedback on the UI and interaction flow.

#### **Deliverables**:
- **Unit tests** for core components.
- **Integration test results**.
- **Usability feedback** from initial user testing.

### **5. Documentation**

As you build the system, it’s essential to document both the technical and user-facing aspects. This will serve as a reference for the team and will also help when introducing new team members or scaling the project.

#### **Types of Documentation**:
- **Code Documentation**: Document the architecture, core components, and the purpose of key functions and modules.
- **User Documentation**: Provide early documentation for end-users, including how to use the basic tools (drawing, saving, etc.).

#### **Deliverables**:
- **Code documentation** for core modules (e.g., functions, classes).
- **User guide** for the basic functionality of the application.
